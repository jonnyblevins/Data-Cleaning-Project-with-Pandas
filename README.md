# Data Cleaning Project with Pandas
TLDR:
In the "Data Ingestion and Cleaning for Analysis using Python" project, you create a robust data pipeline that automates the ingestion, cleaning, and preparation of data from a future-proof source for analytical use. The function must support and convert various data formats and sources. Please ensure the pipeline efficiently ingests data into a Pandas DataFrame, identifies and rectifies inconsistencies like missing values, case sensitivity, or other outliers. Please make sure it standardizes data types and transforms data through derived columns, especially for financial calculations. Develop the pipeline to be easily adaptable for future datasets, with parameterization for different sources and cleaning criteria. Test and validate in the code the pipeline to confirm its accuracy and reliability. The result should yield a cleaned dataset.

CODE BREAKDOWN:

UPLOADING
The code begins with a function asking for two parameters: give the location or source of data, and what format you'd like it to be in. The default is currently to 'csv'.

I've used a try block for error handling to upload the data. The code inside this block is attempted, and if any exceptions (errors) occur, the except block takes over. I had to ask for help with this one, but apparently it ensures that if any error occurs outside of what I'm considering, along with raise, and it will still be caught.

I've inserted some cases within the try block that catch any errors that I'm aware of, like a wrong format or unsupported file, and also thought to check and make sure the sheet given contains all column names for the DataFrame.

If no exceptions are raised and all expected columns are present, the df should be returned for the next step.

FIND MISSING VALUES
With the function, report_missing_values, I ask for one parameter now that it's good to start its mission, the DataFrame df, and get to work.

I figured isnull might be easy to work with, since it's a Boolean (any excuse to get closer to computer binary, TRUE/FALSE is it 1 or 0?). So I calculate how many True values appear, and add with the sum method all the True values for each column. We then divide the missing_values by the length of the DataFrame (len(number of rows)) to get a fraction. Then multiply by 100 to convert it to a percentage. This is probably overthinking it, but I wanted to figure out a way to "future-proof" the total number. Missing_report will then return if it is greater than 0, and it showed 5 from the sample dataset. With this seciton we will at least know what's missing.

CLEANING & TRANSFORMATION

The clean_and_transform_data function takes that DataFrame and and performs data cleaning and transformation. Initially, it reports missing values, converts date columns to datetime format, and ensures numeric columns contain only numeric values. Placeholder lambda functions suggest spots for more complex cleaning operations. The function then applies these cleaning operations to specified columns, demonstrating a framework for data cleaning that can be expanded with more specific logic.

In a nutshell, the code is cleaning the data by removing extreme values (outliers) and filling in gaps (missing values) to make the dataset more uniform and easier to analyze.
